Yes, i did not forget about this blog.

Sorry for not posting anything in months, i've been very busy lately.

[status.nihil.gay](https://status.nihil.gay/) is up, it's just a simple HTML status page that checks for the availability of nihil.gay using your browser and the [RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net/).

It's hosted on Codeberg Pages (as to ideally function when the main nihil.gay server is down).

That's it, right now it's not very useful because only very few things are hosted on nihil.gay, but in the (ideally near) future nihil.gay will move on dedicated hardware with a bunch more stuff hosted there, so i just wanted to get this done with.

## To finish

I have a few other posts in my backlog that i still need to finish and post in the coming weeks when i'm done with my exams.

That's it for today!
